Before you start, you will need Python on your computer, but you may not need to download it.

First of all check that you don't already have Python installed by entering "python" in a command line window. If you see a response from a Python interpreter it will include a version number in its initial display. Generally any recent version will do, as Python makes every attempt to maintain backwards compatibility.


Python releases of both versions can be found here: [http://www.python.org/download/releases/]

This repository has all my notes on python and corresponding tests


####To run any of these files, open your terminal and cd into the folder where the file is located and run "python {filename}" without the .py to run it.


To get started learning python I suggest you start in the python version 2 folder > basics and read and play with those concepts.  Then 
look at the advanced folder and continue.  When you are done learn the differences between python 2 and 3 by looking 
at the python 3 folder.



### I Hope to cover all these topics as I attempt to learn python 
* Print Output
* Dictionary
* Lists
* Unit Testing
* imports
* File IO
* Loops
* Exception Handling
* Classes
* SQL-lite 3

**and anything else I learn as I go on**



For my benefit I am trying to make cryptographic ciphers to culminate in
my learning, ignore that folder if you are not interested.
