The pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action. For example:

Another place pass can be used is as a place-holder for a function or conditional body when you are working on new code,
allowing you to keep thinking at a more abstract level. The pass is silently ignored:




Pass is mainly used when you make a function or a loop and want to fill it in later but you still want to be able to run your program.
